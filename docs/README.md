# Good Image Terminal

## A Wrong Tool for the Job

<!-- This project uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) to run Python directly in the browser using WebAssembly (WASM).  
Almost no JavaScript is required — the frontend is written entirely in Python and HTML/CSS. -->

This project is a web-based image editing tool that runs entirely in the browser through a terminal. It uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) to enable Python-based image processing without the need for a backend server. All while letting JavaScript sit back, relax, and just load the page.

The tool allows users to upload images and apply edits through various commands, all within a user-friendly interface.

The inherently visual task of image editing performed entirely through programmatic terminal commands makes Good Image Terminal the "Wrong tool for the job." Despite this dissonance, we've made GIT comfortable and responsive.

## Packages

This project uses the following packages:

- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) - for image processing
- [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) - to run Python in the browser and for in-browser file management
- [Webcolors](https://pypi.org/project/webcolors/) - used to parse hex and CSS named colors
